\section{Overview}
\subsection{Needs Statement}
The New York Times reports that an average American family of four will account for over 120 pounds of food waste per month and that 27\% percent of all food available will be lost to waste \cite{times}. In addition, other resources are lost due to inefficient shopping practices; forgetting common items or special trips made for recipe ingredients waste time and fuel. A system is required for shoppers to both ensure their purchases are used before expiration and to assist in planning of grocery shopping trips.
\subsection{Objective Statement}
The objective of this project is to design a prototype that will allow a user to scan in food items in order to reduce waste and improve shopping efficiency. The system will remind the user about items nearing their expiration date and track the frequency of purchased items. From this frequency calculation the system will suggest typical shopping lists. A mobile phone application will provide an interface to the unit to view or create shopping lists and to query inventory.
\subsection{Brief Description}
A UPC scanner will be used to identify items added or removed from the refrigerator's inventory; a database of UPC codes will translate from the scanned code to an item description. Two databases will be maintained, one linking UPC codes to product descriptions and expiration dates and another to store items currently checked into the refrigerator. A central processing platform on the base station will be used to decode UPC information and to store and interact with the databases. This platform will provide a web interface accessible both via a large convenient display on the main unit and also using a mobile interface. The display on the main unit will allow a user to both check current inventory with expiration dates and to provide additional information when adding or removing items. Both the base station and mobile interfaces can also be used to display and modify suggested shopping lists. The mobile application will interact with the same web interface but will provide a similar interface optimized for smaller displays. The system will continually estimate the frequency that particular items are purchased and will use this information combined with the expiration dates and purchase dates to suggest shopping lists.

\section{Concept Selection}
\subsection{Evaluation of Existing Systems}
Many refrigerator systems are current available which offer integrated displays and internet connectivity. LG, Electrolux, and Samsung all offer refrigerators with large LCD displays that provide access to calendar applications, recipes, weather forecasts, and music and photo sharing services. The principle shortcoming of these devices is the elevated price and the need to completely replace existing appliances. As a more affordable alternative, tablet mounts are available for refrigerators as well.
However, these systems do not offer tracking of the refrigerator's contents and do not attempt to reduce waste or improve efficiency. LG demonstrated in April, 2011 a ``Smart Fridge" with goals closer to the proposed system. The sensors and algorithms used were not disclosed but the product objective is similar, tracking user purchases and providing a mobile interface to the refrigerator's contents while shopping \cite{lg}. Our system will provide a much more inexpensive alternative and will be more flexible; the system proposed will not be limited to strictly refrigerators and can be used as an add-on to an existing system.
\subsection{Concepts Considered and Chosen}
Many of the system design choices are easily derived from the engineering requirements; a UPC scanner with a standard USB interface is a clear choice for input of product codes and a mobile application is an obvious interface choice for a system catering to an on-the-go shopper. However, the choice of implementation platform and main base station display presents more alternatives. Expiration date recognition is also a potential shortcoming of the system; ideally image processing could be employed to read in expiration dates. However, the difficulty and computational complexity of applying image processing significantly extends the scope of the project and places additional performance constraints on the processing platform used. An evaluation of different expiration date recognition systems are tabulated in Table \ref{tab:datesys}, below.
\begin{table}[h!]
\begin{tabular}{| p{2in} | p{1in} | p{1.5in} | p{1.5in} | p{1.5in} |}
\cline{2-4}

\end{tabular}
\caption{Comparison of Expiration Date Systems}
\label{tab:datesys}
\end{table}
Ease of Use is one of the most critical system requirements, which eliminates a system relying completely on input from the user. However, feasibility and limiting processing performance required are important secondary objectives. Accuracy is critical to the goal of reducing waste due to expiration but there is inherently some variability even in reported expiration dates and image processing presents too much additional scope and too many additional requirements in exchange for marginal gains. As long as the predictive system learns from user input and anticipates that items will be purchased in different conditions, this scheme should be sufficient.
\newline \quad \newline
The choice of the base station main display and processing platform are linked but directed mainly by the processing platform. For example, if a personal computer was used a standard LCD monitor may be appropriate whereas if a tablet was chosen as the main processing engine the interface would be provided automatically. The most strongly considered option was to use a simple micro-controller to handle the processing load and to use a large, relative to the micro-controller, LCD display. Comparisons of different processing platform methods and different user interface choices for the base station are shown in Tables \ref{tab:proc} and \ref{tab:disp}, respectively.

\end{table}
\noindent Evaluating both the interface choice and the processing platform choice together eliminates the personal computer choice; a personal computer can not be integrated without significantly increasing the form factor of the system. A personal computer also greatly simplifies the system and strays away from an implementation tailored to this prototype. A tablet based interface was considered a very feasible alternative; however the cost and tailorability of the system are again concerns. A micro-controller based system is more appropriate for a small and specialized solution, with the principle concern being quality of the graphical interface produced compared with the other two methods. However, since the system will provide a general web interface, the mobile application as well as a variety of other possible interfaces can be used to view the display as well so the weight assigned to a high-quality base station interface is mitigated. Considering both choices together, the micro-controller route with an LCD display to visually inspect items as they are checked in and view inventory appears preferable.
\newline \quad \newline
Consideration of the these concerns, as well as the high level system diagram presented in Figure \ref{fig:sysdiag}, clarifies the separation of tasks while implementing the project. One group of tasks will contain the mobile interface and also development of an Interface Control Document (ICD) to enumerate the commands provided over the web interface. A second task group will consist of developing the internal databases, the expiration date warning system, and shopping list suggestion algorithm. The final group of tasks will consist of interfacing the micro-controller with the scanner, Ethernet interface, and with the main base station interface. The final task group will also contain development of the base station interface.
